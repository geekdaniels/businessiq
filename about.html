                    <p>BusinessIQ is a digital magazine for aspiring and budding entrepreneurs. It is the fastest and largest circulating business magazine in Africa. It focuses on interviewing successful business leaders to inspire and educate entrepreneurs in Africa. Although it is presently read by thousands across the globe, the unchangeable goal is to reach one billion entrepreneurs around the planet.</p>

                    <p>Launched by entrepreneur Alfred Ade-Ijimakinwa in 2009 with nothing, but a Pentium II laptop giving to him by his younger brother and less than fifty dollars, BusinessIQ began to help entrepreneurs start, manage and grow their businesses. And that is not changing.</p>

                            <p>In November 2009, during the financial crunch, when companies were downsizing, businesses were closing down and people were losing their jobs, Alfred Ade-Ijimakinwa saw the future. He perceived that the aftermath of the crisis would birth hundreds of inexperience entrepreneurs who would need a practical business manual to run their businesses. And so, he launched BusinessIQ hard-copy magazine during the recession. And it served its primary purpose by helping its readers grow their businesses and personal lives.</p>

                            <p>Again in 2013, Alfred Ade-Ijimakinwa saw a glimpse of the future. He realized that there is need to help and inspire budding entrepreneurs across Africa with the tough, but success stories of established entrepreneurs. He realized that the surest way to read them is through the internet. So began the amazing journey of creating this online platform. And in July 2014, with a small team, he successfully launched the first issue of BusinessIQ digital magazine featuring Late Dr. Nelson “Madiba” Mandela (1918-2013) on the cover. That maiden issue was titled The Business Side of Nelson Mandela. It went viral. It was timely for it was downloaded from all over Africa and beyond. This assured Alfred Ade-Ijimakinwa and the team that they have started a revolution; the beginning of the future that was seen when BusinessIQ digital magazine was conceived.</p>
